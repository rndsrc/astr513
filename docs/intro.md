# Introduction

Modern astrophysics depends on computational methods and statistical
analysis, alongside observations and theoretical studies.
ASTR 513 offers a comprehensive introduction to the essential skills
needed for computation- and data-driven astrophysics.
Students will learn modern statistical methods, including both
frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and apply these techniques to
astrophysical research.
Additionally, the course will cover a range of computational and
numerical methods, such as Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) and
Partial Differential Equation (PDE) integration, equipping students
with the tools necessary to solve complex numerical problems in
astrophysics.
The curriculum is designed to bridge theoretical concepts with
practical applications.
Through a combination of lectures, hands-on exercises, and projects,
students will develop a robust understanding of the essential tools
and techniques required for modern astrophysical research.
